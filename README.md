## 🔍 Usage

Required [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v20 or higher with NPM package manager.

### Clone the template

```sh
npx degit github:wevisdemo/e-initiative-template <project-name>
```

The template will be downloaded to the `project-name` folder.

### Set up data sources

#### Firebase

For online signature submission

1. Create a new project in [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Set up **Authentication**
   2.1. Enable _"Email/Password"_ and _"Anonymous"_ sign-in methods.
   2.2. Add user and provide email/password for the admin account. Then add the same information in the local `.env.production` file (create it in the project folder if it does not exist) with the `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` keys.
   2.3. Copy the admin's User UID for the next step.
3. Set up **Firestore Database**
   3.1 Enable the Firestore
   3.2 Copy rules from [`firestore.rules`](firestore.rules) and update admin's UID from the previous step. (Only update rules on the console, [`firestore.rules`](firestore.rules) is used by the local emulator)
4. Obtain Firebase config
   3.1 Add a new web app from project settings > General > Your Apps
   3.2 Copy `firebaseConfig` as a one-line JSON format and put it in `PUBLIC_FIREBASE_CONFIG` of the local `.env.production` file.

At the end, your `.env.production` file should look like this:

```env
PUBLIC_FIREBASE_CONFIG={"apiKey": "???", "authDomain": "???", "projectId": "???", "storageBucket": "???", "messagingSenderId": "???", "appId": "???"}
ADMIN_EMAIL=???
ADMIN_PASSWORD=???
```

**Note:** There is a `.env.development` with mocked data for working with the Firebase emulator in the local development environment. You don't need to change anything there.

#### Cloudflare Turnstile

[Cloudflare Turnstile](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/) is used as a CAPTCHA alternative to protect the online signature form from bots and spam submissions. The token is verified server-side in the Firebase Cloud Function before a submission is accepted.

1. Go to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and navigate to **Turnstile**.
2. Add a new site and configure the allowed hostnames for your campaign domain.
3. Copy the **Site Key** and add it to your `.env.production` file:
   ```env
   PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=<your-site-key>
   ```
4. Copy the **Secret Key** and add it to the Cloud Functions environment. If using the Firebase CLI, set it via `functions/.env`:
   ```env
   TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key>
   ```

Your `.env.production` should now include:

```env
PUBLIC_FIREBASE_CONFIG={"apiKey": "???", ...}
PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=???
ADMIN_EMAIL=???
ADMIN_PASSWORD=???
```

**Note:** The `.env.development` and `functions/.env.local` files already contain Cloudflare's [test keys](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/troubleshooting/testing/) that always pass verification, so Turnstile works out of the box in the local development environment.

#### Google Sheets

For human-curated data, including offline signature count and voluntary sign locations. You can skip this step if your campaign doesn't need both functions.

1. Duplicate [Google Sheets template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PPl4bIKrNC68nc9sWDp7aolnTv0xiHZYQRlsvnRpAHc/edit?usp=sharing). It contains 2 sheets:
   - **"offline-signature"** sheets for recording offline signature count in each day. The total number is the summation of every row.
   - **"locations"** is the sign location showing in the location page.
2. Grant _"Viewer"_ permission to _"Anyone with the link"_ in Share menu
3. Obtain Sheets ID from the URL `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/{sheetsID}/` and add it to the `sheets.id` in [`e-initiative.config.mjs`](e-initiative.config.mjs)
4. _(Optional)_ If you allow anyone to submit a voluntary offline sign location.
   4.1. Create a Google Form with fields corresponding to the columns in the `locations` sheet.
   4.2. In the form response settings, link the form response to your duplicated sheets. A response sheet will be created with each question in the header.
   4.2. Rename the column header to be like the `locations` sheet. Doesn't need to have the same order, but it must correspond to each question.
   4.3 Remove the old `locations` sheet and rename the form response sheet to `locations` instead.

### Configuration file

Most of the campaign information can be configured via [`e-initiative.config.mjs`](e-initiative.config.mjs). Explanation can be found by hovering at the configuration keys (on JSDoc supported IDE) or the [type definition file](src/models/config.d.ts). Configuration should be updated first so that you will know what is not covered and require editing the source code.

### Campaign website

#### Development

- Website content can be directly edited through source code. The index page entry point to get started is [`src/pages/index.astro`](src/pages/index.astro).
- UI components are from either [Daisy UI v3](v3.daisyui.com) or custom-made available in [`src/components`](src/components). Svelte is mainly used, but you can install additional[ UI Framework integration for Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/framework-components/)
- Color theme defined in [`e-initiative.config.mjs`](e-initiative.config.mjs) is available as a Tailwind class. For VSCode users, Tailwind extension is recommended for Tailwind class auto-completion.
- Typography CSS global utility classes are defined in [`src/styles/typography.css`](src/styles/typography.css) and ready to be used.
- Design system corresponds to the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/CmcP7sbvY4KSRshC2fKCfD/e-initiative-template)
- Don't forget to review the privacy policy in [`src/pages/privacy-policy.astro`](src/pages/privacy-policy.astro) and remove the _"mark"_ tags (for highlighting) after updating the content.

To start Astro development server and Firebase emulator:

```sh
npm run dev
```

During the development mode, any changes to Firebase will be in the local emulator, leaving the production database untouched. Mock data will be initialized in the Firestore emulator for post-campaign script testing. The [`.env.development`](.env.developmen) is used.

#### Build

To build a website for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

The static site will be generated to `/dist` and we can preview the production build with

```sh
npm run preview
```

Note that the production build will use `.env.production` and the real Firebase, not the emulator.

#### Deployment

Since Astro uses Static Site Generation (SSG), no data from Firebase and Google Sheets will be updated after the build. So we recommended using CI/CD tools that support scheduled deployment such as GitHub Actions. Then we can periodically re-build and re-deploy in a given period. Don't forget to add all the production environment variables to the CI/CD.

The template also includes GitHub Action's workflow file [`.github/workflows/demo.yaml`](.github/workflows/demo.yaml). Please remove it before pushing to GitHub if you don't want to use it. But if you do, don't forget to add all the production environment variables as a repository secret and remove the `PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE` env from the _Build with Astro_ step.

### Post-campaign scripts

Your PDF output template might not have the same field value/position as our given template. Before using the thousands of production records, we recommend testing with one record of mock data first.

#### Test and adjustment with mock data

To get mock data (Firebase emulator must be running from `dev` or `dev:firebase` command):

```sh
npm run download:local
```

Output CSV files will be generated to the `/out` directory: one version with base64 signature data, and one version without it. Then start the renderer in watch mode:

```sh
npm run render:watch
```

The output PDF files will be re-generated to `/out` directory every time any file has changed. Keep adjusting the `renderer` config in [`e-initiative.config.mjs`](e-initiative.config.mjs) until the output PDF looks pretty.

#### Download and render production data

First, download the production signatories' data in CSV format (duplicated or invalid records will be filtered out):

```sh
npm run download:prod
```

Then, render to the PDF files:

```sh
npm run render
```

Both CSV and PDF files will be generated to `/out` directory, replacing existing data if exists (eg. from mock data).

## 📚 Appendix

### How to make a legislative initiative?

Citizens have the right to propose a law draft to the parliament when they can gather enough signatures (more about [Thailand legislative process](https://parliamentwatch.wevis.info/legislative-process)). The initiative leader usually follows this pattern:

1. **Pre-campaign**

   - Create a law draft
   - Design campaign content and activities

2. **Campaign**
   - Promote the initiative
   - Collect citizen signatures through offline/online channel
3. **Post campaign**
   - Submit the draft together with all the signatures to the parliament
